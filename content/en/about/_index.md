## ðŸ‘‹ A Bit About Me

It all started with curiosity â€” the desire to understand how things work beneath the surface. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a passion for building systems that donâ€™t just run, but truly **solve real-world problems**.  

Backend development became the perfect playground for this mindset. The beauty of designing something invisible yet essential â€” APIs, data pipelines, architectures â€” is that it quietly powers experiences millions of people rely on without even noticing.  

The more I built, the more I realized that technology isnâ€™t about code alone. Itâ€™s about understanding the **why** behind every decision, the **impact** behind every feature, and the **people** behind every problem. Thatâ€™s what drives me: turning complex challenges into elegant, scalable, and meaningful solutions.

This space is where I share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way â€” thoughts on technology, software design, performance, and the lessons from building systems that aim to make a difference.
