[{"content":"ðŸ¤– A Convenient Revolution With a Hidden Cost Artificial intelligence has completely transformed how developers work. From generating code snippets to designing full architectures, tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have turned tasks that once took hours into minutes. And while that might sound like an undeniable win, thereâ€™s a darker side to this convenience: weâ€™re slowly losing the very skills that made us engineers in the first place.\nThe Decline of Engineering Thinking Software engineering has always been about problem-solving. Itâ€™s about breaking complex challenges into smaller, logical steps and designing solutions that are robust, scalable, and maintainable. But when AI writes the solution for you, that process often disappears.\nDevelopers stop questioning why something works and focus only on what works. The result is code that runs but isnâ€™t understood. And when problems arise â€” and they always do â€” many struggle to fix them because they never understood the underlying design.\nFast Solutions, Shallow Knowledge Itâ€™s never been easier to build something quickly. Need an API? Ask AI. Want a database query? Ask AI. But speed often comes at the cost of depth.\nWithout understanding trade-offs, patterns, and long-term implications, developers risk creating software that looks good today but becomes technical debt tomorrow. The craft of thinking critically about systems is quietly fading away.\nThe Real Role of AI This doesnâ€™t mean AI is bad. In fact, itâ€™s an incredible tool â€” if used wisely. The danger is not in the technology itself but in how we approach it. AI should be a partner, not a crutch. It should help us go further, not excuse us from understanding the fundamentals.\nThe best engineers of the future will not be those who rely on AI blindly, but those who use it as an amplifier of their expertise. They will still think deeply, design carefully, and question relentlessly â€” because engineering isnâ€™t about writing code. Itâ€™s about solving problems.\nðŸš€ The Challenge Ahead The next generation of developers faces a choice. They can use AI to automate their thinking â€” or they can use it to elevate it. The difference will define the future of software engineering.\n","permalink":"https://pwuexec.com/en/posts/ai-and-developers/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-a-convenient-revolution-with-a-hidden-cost\"\u003eðŸ¤– A Convenient Revolution With a Hidden Cost\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtificial intelligence has completely transformed how developers work.
